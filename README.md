# Welcome!

Your JavaScript module was successfully created. If this is your first time creating a module, you may want to consult the [Getting Started guide](https://academy.jahia.com/tutorials-get-started/front-end-developer/setting-up-your-dev-environment#create-a-new-project).

This README assumes you have a working development environment with Node.js, Yarn and Docker installed and configured. Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://academy.jahia.com/tutorials-get-started/front-end-developer/setting-up-your-dev-environment) guide if you need help setting up your environment.

## Getting Started

This module is accompanied by a Docker-based development environment. To get started, follow these steps:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start Jahia in Docker
docker compose up --wait

# Build the module and start the dev mode
yarn build && yarn dev
```

These commands will start a Jahia instance in a Docker container, build your module and start a watcher that will rebuild the module every time you make changes to the source code.

## Commands

This module comes with some scripts to help you develop your module. You can run them with `yarn <script>`:

| Category     | Script                | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build        | `build`               | Produces a deployable artifact that can be uploaded to a Jahia instance |
| Build        | `deploy`              | Pushes the build artifact to a Jahia instance                           |
| Development  | `dev` (alias `watch`) | Watches for changes and rebuilds the module                             |
| Code quality | `format`              | Runs Prettier (a code formatter) on your code                           |
| Code quality | `lint`                | Runs ESLint (a linter) on your code                                     |
