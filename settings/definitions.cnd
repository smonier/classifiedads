// Defining the content types is similar to defining a data model: once deployed, you cannot change the type of a property.
// If you need to do changes during the development phase, it is possible to remove the definitions from the tools:
// http://localhost:8080/cms/login?redirect=/modules/tools/definitionsBrowser.jsp however that will remove content created with this type.
// Learn more about content types definitions here:
// https://github.com/Jahia/javascript-modules/tree/main/docs/3-reference/1-cnd-format/

// This mixin creates a category to regroup types in the content type selector UI. Apply it to any definition you want
// to see in this category.
